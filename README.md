# Applied-Signal-Processing-to-SoundSourceLocalisation:

Goal is to estimate the location of sound source using microphones array.
Various Applied Signal Processing Algorithms are studied.

Least Square method is used to estimate time delays. 
Steepest descent algorithm is designed for localisation of exact location. 

Implemented and verified on MATLAB.
Vartion with Convergence with number of iterations are observed.
